# Competitive Programming

This repo contains:

1. `practice/` - solutions to a number of problems I've solved on various competitive programming websites - mainly codeforces but also codechef, SPOJ, UVA, atcoder etc.
2. `learning/` - code related to learning new topics.
3. `lists/` - curated list of "good" problems. "Good" is whatever I find difficult and interesting and think is worth making a note of lest I forget the method of solving similar problems.

I don't imagine this to be of any use to anyone else other than me. But if you're here and reading this... maybe ask yourself why :)
